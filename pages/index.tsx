          <AboutUsDetail>
            <div>
              <p>A family owned and operated local business, Andrew and Vicci Reid noticed the lack of home improvement specialists that offered more skills than your typical handyman, without the expense of enlisting a building company. From this, Reidy’s Renos and Repairs was born.</p>
              <p>From everyday tasks like hanging doors to those tricky home fixes that need a clever touch, we’ve got the skills to help — without the overhead or high prices of larger companies.</p>
              <p>We specialise in home improvements, repairs, and renovations, but we can also oversee  building projects and coordinate any other tradesmen who are required such as plumbers or electricians.</p>
              <p>Find out why Darwin and Palmerston locals prefer our personal and reliable service.</p>
